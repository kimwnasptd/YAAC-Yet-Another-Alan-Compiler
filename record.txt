TODO:

*** Scopes
**  Related with Scopes. Talk about recursion
**  Bytes (instructions between them)
*   Make sure in strings to use "



LAST CHANGES:
------------

* Proc now doesn't need a return;
  Added: endblock (CodegenUtilities)
         edited cgen_main, cgenFuncDef because of endblock

** If NOW works
  See codegen utilities, lines 180-200.
  An if block could create an exit block, that may have been empty.
  Now if a blockstate has no terminator, but also no instructions,
  We don't make a corresponding AST represenation of that block!
