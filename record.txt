1) Amend strings:  done, the problem was that both the $printable and $esc_seq arguments, used to identify strings, also contained the character "
2) Amend comments:   probably only partially done. *  We still have the EOF issue???
3) Create a rÎ¿bust token data type that contains line info
4) Locate the shift reduce conflict on the parser




* If we are inside a comment that starts with "(*" , EVERYTHING INSIDE THE COMMENT , except "*)" must be ignored.
So, we match with "--" only if we are outside any other comment.
e.g.     (*   something something -- other other *) : This comment must be closed
