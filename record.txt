ToDo:

    1) Create a rÎ¿bust token data type that contains line info   --> Will be done later today
    2) Locate the shift reduce conflict on the parser (nothing to do here) 

Done:
    2) If you check the Parser.info file, the shift reduce conflict
    refers to State 114, the famous dangling if issue. The default
    shift behaviour is fine, nothing to do.




Take a Look:

    Changed the way we were matching strings a little. Added a convEsc fun that converts the matched
    characters to their correct values (ex \\n is matched and then converted to \n)
    --> Looks much better, thank you

    Shift Reduce: In the hannoi.alan program if we remove the if (...) { } and keep its body for some
    reason it compiles. Guess the conflict is somewhere there?
    -> Fixed, it was just a simple bug on the >= and <= conditions on the parser
