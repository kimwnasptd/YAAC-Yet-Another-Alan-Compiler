ToDo:

    1) Create a rÎ¿bust token data type that contains line info
    2) Locate the shift reduce conflict on the parser (Check below)



Take a Look:

    Changed the way we were matching strings a little. Added a convEsc fun that converts the matched
    characters to their correct values (ex \\n is matched and then converted to \n)

    Shift Reduce: In the hannoi.alan program if we remove the if (...) { } and keep its body for some
    reason it compiles. Guess the conflict is somewhere there?
